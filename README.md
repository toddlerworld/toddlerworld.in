## Running the project locally

**Recommended:**

Install docker and run it through docker. This will ensure that the application runs in the same environment as it
would on the server. To run the application through docker, run the following commands:

```docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up```

The above command will create the docker image and run the application on your local machine.

The below command is used to run the application in the background:

```docker run toddler-world-dev```

If you've added packages, created new files, or added new images, keep in mind to update the docker image for it to run
using the command

`docker-compose up --build`

The application will be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Easiest:**

The simplest way to run this application is by cloning the repository, installing the dependencies by using the
command `yarn` and running the application on your local machine. Once everything is installed,
run `yarn start` to start the application.
