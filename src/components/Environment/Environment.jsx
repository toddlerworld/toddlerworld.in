          Toddler World is a space where once the child walks in, he is so lured
          that he is unable to withdraw from it. Our well-designed environment
          not only supports child's growth and development but also affirms
          family's expectations of high quality.
          <strong>Peace of mind</strong>
          We understand that the safety and well-being of your child is your top
          priority. That's why we go above and beyond to ensure your child feels
          safe, comfortable, and cared forâ€”in all dimensions of our programme.
          <strong>Home away from home</strong>
          We provide your child home away from home. Our personalised, nurturing
          vibe even carries over to our buildings and grounds. The nursery has
          been specifically designed to create a fun, interactive, and dynamic
          experience. At Toddler World, you can be sure that your child will
          gain the first steps toward a lifelong love of learning.
          <strong>Caring Growth Environment</strong>
          Our dedicated staff is trained to create an environment which caters
          to:
          <ul>
            <li>Different stages of development of the child</li>
            <li>Individual differences amongst children</li>
            <li>Varied potentials/skills of individual children</li>
            <li>Last but not the least, all aspects of intelligence</li>
          </ul>
          Our space is intentionally designed to give your child the best
          possible experience!
